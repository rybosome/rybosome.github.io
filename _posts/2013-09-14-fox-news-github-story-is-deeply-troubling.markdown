title: "The Fox News GitHub Story is Deeply Troubling"
---

The cringeworthy [coverage of GitHub][fox-youtube-video] recently aired by Fox News has been making the rounds on programming forums.
The general reaction seems to have been mostly mocking and dismissive due to their
mistake-laden treatment, but I was surprised to find myself unamused; in fact, I was actively upset.
It wasn't the minutiae, like their incorrect term usage.
Although I failed to suppress an eye-roll at the line, "I'd like to fork a repo on GitHub, but I
need to send a pull request first", that is hardly worth getting worked up over. The fact that it was slightly uncomfortable isn't what
bothered me either. I have difficulty watching situations that I feel are embarrassing (I often couldn't
even look at the screen when watching "[The Office][the-office-clip]"), but after I
cleared the first 40 squirm-inducing seconds, the rest wasn't so bad. It took some time for me to
assess my feelings, but I eventually realized that what bothered me was the portrayal of GitHub
users as a geeky, byzantine subculture.

Specifically, it was the statement that this is "brainiac" stuff which really irritated me.
Presenting technology (or science, or math) as an enigma to all but a few of the intelligent elite
is harmful, even when the tone is lighthearted. The awful thing is, this "too hard for me" belief is
incredibly widespread. I've known so many people who, when confronting a problem in technology,
throw up their hands and say "Fuck it. I'm too old/not smart enough/don't really need to know this."
This disinclination towards understanding technology isn't just depressing, it's actively dangerous.
Whether or not you believe in [the singularity][the-singularity], it is clear that our lives are becoming more and
more intertwined with, and dependent upon, technology. We are dealing with issues that will impact
the future course of humanity - having cursory knowledge of things like [cloning][cloning], [environmental
changes][environmental-changes], [digital privacy][digital-privacy] and [cyber-warfare][cyber-warfare]
is necessary to have an informed opinion.

Being a citizen of the 21st-century requires a more thorough understanding
of our world than at any other point in history.  Between the [stifling homogeneity][stem-stats] of the STEM
workforce, the United States' [comparatively abysmal][us-education] science and math education, and this dismissive
apathy towards understanding technology, I am worried that we aren't producing enough rational
voices. If we want this to change, we have to stop portraying technology as arcana - any knowledge
is attainable to those who want it badly enough.
